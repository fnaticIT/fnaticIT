# 👋 Hi, I’m @fnaticIT (Naman Balai)

🚀 Applications Developer at Oracle | B.Tech CSE from NIT Warangal

🛠️ I build robust, scalable, and user-centric applications — from HR platforms at scale to full-stack web and mobile apps.
Currently working with **Oracle ADF**, **JavaScript**, and **SQL**, and experienced with **MERN**, **React Native**, and system design.

🔍 I’m exploring the practical side of **AI**, **machine learning**, and **federated learning** — including real-world implementations like stress detection and behavior analysis.

💡 I enjoy working on projects that solve real problems — especially ones that involve human behavior, productivity, or collaboration.
